    <h1>Rules for Using Articles</h1>

    <p>An article is a word that defines a noun as specific or unspecific. The two main types of articles in English are definite and indefinite.</p>

    <h2>Types of Articles:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definite Article: The</strong></li>
        <p>Used to refer to a specific noun known to both the speaker and listener, or one that is unique.</p>
        <p>Example: The book on the table is mine. / The sun rises in the east.</p>

        <li><strong>Indefinite Articles: A and An</strong></li>
        <p>Used when referring to a non-specific noun or when the noun is mentioned for the first time.</p>
        <p>A is used before words that begin with a consonant sound.</p>
        <p>Example: A cat is in the garden.</p>
        <p>An is used before words that begin with a vowel sound.</p>
        <p>Example: An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use "The":</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When the noun is specific or known to both the speaker and listener.</li>
        <p>Example: The car I bought last week is blue.</p>
        
        <li>When the noun is unique, like natural landmarks or celestial bodies.</li>
        <p>Example: The sun rises in the east.</p>
        
        <li>With superlatives and ordinal numbers.</li>
        <p>Example: He is the tallest player.</p>

        <li>When referring to whole groups or categories.</li>
        <p>Example: The lion is a wild animal.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use "A" or "An":</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When the noun is non-specific or mentioned for the first time.</li>
        <p>Example: I saw a dog in the park. (We donâ€™t know which dog.)</p>

        <li>Before professions, nationalities, and religions.</li>
        <p>Example: He is a doctor. / She is an American.</p>

        <li>With countable singular nouns.</li>
        <p>Example: I need a pencil.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Not to Use an Article:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>With general plural nouns or uncountable nouns.</li>
        <p>Example: Books are important. / I love music.</p>

        <li>With names of languages, nationalities, and academic subjects.</li>
        <p>Example: She speaks French. / He studies history.</p>

        <li>With most proper nouns (names of people, countries, cities, etc.).</li>
        <p>Example: I live in Canada. / John is my friend.</p>

        <li>With meals, days of the week, and months when referring to general time.</li>
        <p>Example: We have lunch at 1 PM. / Monday is my favorite day.</p>
    </ul>
