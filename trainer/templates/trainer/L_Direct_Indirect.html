    <h1>Direct and Indirect Speech</h1>

    <h2>1. Direct Speech</h2>
    <p>Direct speech involves quoting someone's exact words, often within quotation marks. It presents the speaker's words verbatim and maintains the original form and tone.</p>
    
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To convey exact words of the speaker.</li>
        <li>To show immediacy and personal engagement with what the speaker has said.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Structure:</h3>
    <p>Direct speech uses quotation marks around the words being spoken. It may include an introductory phrase (e.g., "She said") to introduce the direct quote. The punctuation marks for the quoted speech (e.g., commas, question marks, exclamation marks) remain intact.</p>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>She said, "I am tired." <code>The words "I am tired" are the exact words spoken by the speaker.</code></li>
        <li>John exclaimed, "Wow, that's amazing!" <code>The exclamation mark is part of the quoted speech.</code></li>
        <li>He said, "I will call you tomorrow." <code>The exact words spoken are reported.</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Direct Speech:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use quotation marks around the exact words spoken.</li>
        <li>Place the reporting verb (e.g., said, asked, exclaimed) before or after the quoted words.</li>
        <li>If the reporting verb comes before the quotation, a comma is used after the reporting verb (e.g., She said, "I'm coming soon").</li>
        <li>If the quotation is a question or exclamation, appropriate punctuation (question mark, exclamation mark) is used inside the quotation marks.</li>
        <li>Capitalization: The first letter of the quoted speech is always capitalized, even if it’s not at the beginning of the sentence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Indirect Speech (Reported Speech)</h2>
    <p>Indirect speech is used to report what someone has said without quoting their exact words. It involves paraphrasing the original statement and often requires changes in pronouns, verb tenses, and other parts of speech to maintain grammatical accuracy.</p>

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To report the content of someone's speech without repeating their exact words.</li>
        <li>To provide a more general or formal account of what was said, often when the exact wording is not necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Structure:</h3>
    <p>Indirect speech generally involves changing the word order from the direct speech form. The reporting verb (e.g., said, told, asked) is followed by the clause that reports the statement, usually without quotation marks. Certain grammatical adjustments are made, such as changes in pronouns, tenses, and time expressions.</p>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> She said, "I am tired." <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> She said that she was tired.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> John said, "I will help you with your homework." <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> John said that he would help me with my homework.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "Where are you going?" he asked. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> He asked where I was going.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Indirect Speech:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No quotation marks are used in indirect speech.</li>
        <li>The reporting verb (e.g., said, asked, told) introduces the speech.</li>
        <li>Pronouns change to reflect the perspective of the reporter (e.g., "I" becomes "she" or "he", "you" becomes "I" or "me").</li>
        <li>Verb tense changes in indirect speech, often shifting backwards in time:
            <ul>
                <li>Present Simple → Past Simple (e.g., "I play" becomes "he played").</li>
                <li>Present Continuous → Past Continuous (e.g., "I am eating" becomes "she was eating").</li>
                <li>Present Perfect → Past Perfect (e.g., "I have done" becomes "they had done").</li>
                <li>Future Simple → Conditional (e.g., "I will go" becomes "he would go").</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the reporting verb is in the past tense, the verb tense in indirect speech usually shifts one step back (known as "backshifting").</li>
        <li>Time expressions change:
            <ul>
                <li>"now" → "then"</li>
                <li>"today" → "that day"</li>
                <li>"tomorrow" → "the next day" or "the following day"</li>
                <li>"yesterday" → "the day before" or "the previous day"</li>
                <li>"here" → "there"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Converting Direct Speech to Indirect Speech:</h3>
    <p>To convert direct speech into indirect speech, follow these general steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the quotation marks.</li>
        <li>Change the pronouns: Replace the speaker’s pronouns with the appropriate ones (e.g., "I" becomes "he/she").</li>
        <li>Backshift the tense: If the reporting verb is in the past tense, shift the tense of the verb in the quoted speech back.</li>
        <li>Adjust time expressions: Modify words that indicate time based on the context of reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> He said, "I am reading a book." <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> He said that he was reading a book.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> She said, "I will meet you at 6 p.m." <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> She said that she would meet me at 6 p.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "Are you coming?" she asked. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> She asked if I was coming.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "We went to the park yesterday," they said. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> They said that they had gone to the park the day before.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Special Cases:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Questions:</strong> When reporting questions in indirect speech, the word order changes, and question marks are not used.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> She said, "Are you going to the party?" <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> She asked if I was going to the party.</li>
                <li>For yes/no questions, we use "if" or "whether" to introduce the reported speech.</li>
                <li>For wh-questions, the word order in the indirect speech remains as a statement.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "Where is the nearest station?" he asked. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> He asked where the nearest station was.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Imperatives:</strong> When reporting commands or requests, we usually use "to" or "not to" with the verb.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "Please close the door," she said. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> She asked me to close the door.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "Don’t be late!" he said. <strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> He told me not to be late.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
