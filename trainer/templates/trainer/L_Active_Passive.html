    <h1>Active and Passive Voice</h1>

    <h2>1. Active Voice</h2>
    <p>In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action of the verb. The focus is on the subject and what it is doing.</p>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To emphasize the doer of the action (the subject).</li>
        <li>To show clear, direct relationships between the subject and the verb.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Structure:</h3>
    <p>Subject + Verb + Object. The subject is the one carrying out the action.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The dog chased the ball. <code>Subject: The dog, Verb: chased, Object: the ball</code></li>
        <li>She wrote a letter. <code>Subject: She, Verb: wrote, Object: a letter</code></li>
        <li>John fixed the car. <code>Subject: John, Verb: fixed, Object: the car</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Active Voice:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The subject must be performing the action.</li>
        <li>The sentence is typically more direct, making it simpler and often more dynamic.</li>
        <li>Active voice is commonly used in everyday conversation, storytelling, and direct communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Passive Voice</h2>
    <p>In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action rather than performing it. The focus shifts to the recipient of the action.</p>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To emphasize the receiver of the action (the object).</li>
        <li>To shift the focus from the doer of the action to the action itself or the recipient of the action.</li>
        <li>Passive voice is often used when the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or less important than the action.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Structure:</h3>
    <p>Subject + form of "to be" + Past Participle (verb) + (by + Agent). The object of the active sentence becomes the subject in the passive sentence.</p>
    <p>A form of the verb "to be" is used (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been) followed by the past participle of the main verb. The doer of the action (the agent) is optional and may be included after "by" if needed for clarification.</p>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ball was chased by the dog. <code>Subject: The ball, Verb: was chased, Agent: by the dog (optional)</code></li>
        <li>A letter was written by her. <code>Subject: A letter, Verb: was written, Agent: by her</code></li>
        <li>The car was fixed by John. <code>Subject: The car, Verb: was fixed, Agent: by John (optional)</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Passive Voice:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The subject of the sentence receives the action.</li>
        <li>The verb must include a form of "to be" (am, is, are, was, were, etc.) and the past participle of the main verb.</li>
        <li>The doer of the action (the agent) is optional in the passive voice and is often omitted when it is unknown, irrelevant, or implied.</li>
        <li>Passive voice is more common in formal writing, scientific reports, and news reporting where the action or result is more important than the agent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Converting Active Voice to Passive Voice:</h3>
    <p>To change a sentence from active voice to passive voice, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the subject, verb, and object in the active sentence.</li>
        <li>Make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive sentence.</li>
        <li>Add a form of the verb "to be" (in the appropriate tense).</li>
        <li>Use the past participle of the main verb.</li>
        <li>Omit or include the agent (doer of the action) after "by" depending on whether it is necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Conversion:</h3>
    <p><strong>Active:</strong> The teacher (subject) teaches (verb) the students (object).</p>
    <p><strong>Passive:</strong> The students (subject) are taught (verb) by the teacher (agent).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step-by-step conversion:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The object of the active sentence ("the students") becomes the subject of the passive sentence.</li>
        <li>The verb "teach" becomes its past participle "taught" and is preceded by the appropriate form of "to be" (are).</li>
        <li>The original subject ("the teacher") becomes the agent in the passive sentence and is introduced by "by" (optional).</li>
        <li>The result is: The students are taught by the teacher.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use Active vs. Passive Voice:</h2>
    <h3>Active Voice:</h3>
    <p>Active voice is preferred in most situations as it is more direct, clear, and concise. It is easier to read and more engaging.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: The committee approved the new policy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Passive Voice:</h3>
    <p>Passive voice is used when the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or when the focus is on the action or result rather than the subject.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: The new policy was approved by the committee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples and Comparisons:</h2>
    <h3>Active Voice:</h3>
    <p>The chef cooked a delicious meal.</p>
    <p><code>Subject: The chef, Verb: cooked, Object: a delicious meal</code></p>

    <h3>Passive Voice:</h3>
    <p>A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.</p>
    <p><code>Subject: A delicious meal, Verb: was cooked, Agent: by the chef (optional)</code></p>

    <h3>Active Voice:</h3>
    <p>The scientist conducted the experiment.</p>
    <p><code>Subject: The scientist, Verb: conducted, Object: the experiment</code></p>

    <h3>Passive Voice:</h3>
    <p>The experiment was conducted by the scientist.</p>
    <p><code>Subject: The experiment, Verb: was conducted, Agent: by the scientist</code></p>

    <h2>When to Avoid Passive Voice:</h2>
    <p>Avoid excessive use of passive voice in writing, as it can lead to vague, wordy, and less engaging sentences.</p>
    <p>Use active voice when the subject performing the action is clear and important.</p>
    <p>Passive voice is often better when the doer is unknown or unimportant, or if the action/result is more important than the agent.</p>
