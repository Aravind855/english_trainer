    <h1>Sentence Structure</h1>

    <h2>1. Subject:</h2>
    <p>The subject is the noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that performs the action in a sentence or is the main focus of the sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The subject tells us who or what the sentence is about.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cat sleeps. (Subject: The cat)</li>
            <li>She is reading a book. (Subject: She)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, the subject can be implied, especially in commands or imperative sentences (e.g., "Go to bed!" where the subject "you" is implied).</p>

    <h2>2. Predicate:</h2>
    <p>The predicate provides information about what the subject does, what happens to the subject, or what state the subject is in. It includes the verb and everything that follows.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The predicate tells what the subject is doing or the action it is performing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cat sleeps. (Predicate: sleeps)</li>
            <li>She is reading a book. (Predicate: is reading a book)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The predicate can be a single verb (e.g., “runs”) or a more complex structure, such as a verb phrase or an entire clause.</p>

    <h2>3. Object:</h2>
    <p>An object is the noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that receives the action of the verb. There are two main types of objects: direct objects and indirect objects.</p>

    <h3>Direct Object:</h3>
    <p>The direct object answers the question what? or whom? about the action of the verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She baked a cake. (Direct Object: a cake)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Indirect Object:</h3>
    <p>The indirect object answers the question to whom? or for whom? the action is performed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She baked her friend a cake. (Indirect Object: her friend)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not all sentences have objects. For example, in the sentence “She sleeps,” there is no object because "sleeps" is an intransitive verb (doesn’t require an object).</p>

    <h2>4. Clauses:</h2>
    <p>A clause is a group of words containing a subject and a predicate. There are two main types of clauses: independent and dependent.</p>

    <h3>Independent Clause:</h3>
    <p>An independent clause (also called a main clause) is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. It has a subject and a predicate and expresses a full idea.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An independent clause expresses a complete thought and can stand alone.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I went home. (Independent Clause)</li>
            <li>She likes ice cream. (Independent Clause)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dependent Clause:</h3>
    <p>A dependent clause (also called a subordinate clause) cannot stand alone because it does not express a complete thought. It needs to be attached to an independent clause to form a complete sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A dependent clause relies on an independent clause to form a complete thought.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Because I was tired, I went home. (Dependent Clause: Because I was tired)</li>
            <li>Although it was raining, we went for a walk. (Dependent Clause: Although it was raining)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Dependent clauses are often introduced by subordinating conjunctions like “because,” “if,” “when,” “although,” and “since.”</p>

    <h2>5. Phrases:</h2>
    <p>A phrase is a group of words that work together to perform a specific function within a sentence but do not contain both a subject and a predicate.</p>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A phrase does not have both a subject and a predicate and cannot stand alone as a sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Under the table (Prepositional Phrase)</li>
            <li>To the store (Infinitive Phrase)</li>
            <li>Baking a cake (Gerund Phrase)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Phrases can be classified based on their structure and function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepositional Phrases:</strong> Start with a preposition and end with a noun or pronoun (e.g., "in the morning," "under the bed").</li>
        <li><strong>Infinitive Phrases:</strong> Begin with the word “to” followed by a verb (e.g., “to eat,” “to go”).</li>
        <li><strong>Gerund Phrases:</strong> Begin with a verb in its “-ing” form and function as a noun (e.g., “baking cookies,” “reading books”).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sentence Structure in Detail:</h2>

    <h3>Simple Sentence:</h3>
    <p>A simple sentence contains only one independent clause and expresses a single complete thought.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She reads a book.</li>
        <li>(One independent clause: She reads a book.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compound Sentence:</h3>
    <p>A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or a semicolon.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She reads a book, and he plays chess.</li>
        <li>(Two independent clauses joined by "and": She reads a book, he plays chess.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Complex Sentence:</h3>
    <p>A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Dependent clauses are connected by subordinating conjunctions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She reads a book because she enjoys learning.</li>
        <li>(Independent clause: She reads a book, Dependent clause: because she enjoys learning)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compound-Complex Sentence:</h3>
    <p>A compound-complex sentence contains two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: She reads a book because she enjoys learning, and he plays chess because it helps him focus.</li>
        <li>(Independent clauses: She reads a book, he plays chess; Dependent clauses: because she enjoys learning, because it helps him focus)</li>
    </ul>


    <title>Sentence Types</title>


    <h1>Sentence Types</h1>

    <p>In English, sentences can be classified into four main types based on their function and the way they communicate information. These sentence types are declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory. Each type has distinct purposes and rules that guide their use. Understanding these sentence types is crucial for effective communication, as each one conveys information in a different way.</p>

    <h2>1. Declarative Sentences:</h2>
    <p>A declarative sentence makes a statement or expresses a fact, idea, or opinion. It is the most common type of sentence in English.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To state something, provide information, or share a fact or opinion.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> The structure follows the pattern of subject + verb + object (though the subject may be implied in some cases).</p>
    <p>Declarative sentences end with a period (.) to signify a statement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I like coffee.</li>
            <li>She enjoys reading books.</li>
            <li>The weather is beautiful today.</li>
            <li>The meeting starts at 3 p.m.</li>
            <li>We live in a small town.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A declarative sentence must be clear and provide straightforward information.</li>
        <li>It can be in any tense (past, present, or future), but its purpose is always to state something.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Interrogative Sentences:</h2>
    <p>An interrogative sentence asks a question and is used to request information or clarification. It always seeks an answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To ask questions or seek information.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Interrogative sentences often begin with a question word (e.g., who, what, where, when, why, how) or an auxiliary verb (e.g., is, are, do, can, will, etc.) at the beginning.</p>
    <p>They typically follow the structure of auxiliary verb + subject + main verb in questions, or question word + auxiliary verb + subject.</p>
    <p>Interrogative sentences end with a question mark (?).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you like coffee? (Auxiliary verb + subject + main verb)</li>
            <li>Where are you going? (Question word + auxiliary verb + subject)</li>
            <li>What time is the meeting? (Question word + auxiliary verb + subject)</li>
            <li>Can I help you with that? (Auxiliary verb + subject + main verb)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>An interrogative sentence is structured with the subject and verb often inverted.</li>
        <li>It must always end with a question mark (?).</li>
        <li>It can be a yes/no question (e.g., "Is she coming?") or a wh- question (e.g., "Where is she going?").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Imperative Sentences:</h2>
    <p>An imperative sentence gives a command, makes a request, or offers advice. It is used to direct someone to do something.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To give a command.</li>
        <li>To make a request or provide instructions.</li>
        <li>To offer advice or suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> The subject is often implied, and it is usually you (the person being addressed).</p>
    <p>The verb is in the base form (infinitive without "to").</p>
    <p>Imperative sentences can end with either a period or an exclamation mark (!) depending on the intensity of the command.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink your coffee. (Command)</li>
            <li>Please pass the salt. (Request)</li>
            <li>Take a deep breath. (Advice)</li>
            <li>Stop right there! (Strong command)</li>
            <li>Go to bed now. (Command)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The subject ("you") is typically not explicitly stated, as it is understood.</li>
        <li>Imperative sentences can be polite requests (with "please") or direct commands.</li>
        <li>They end with either a period (.) for a soft command or request, or an exclamation mark (!) for a strong imperative.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of tone and context, as the command can be perceived as rude if not framed politely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Exclamatory Sentences:</h2>
    <p>An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotions such as surprise, excitement, joy, or anger. It is used to convey a sense of urgency or intensity.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To express strong emotion such as excitement, joy, anger, or astonishment.</li>
        <li>To show surprise, admiration, or frustration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Exclamatory sentences often begin with an exclamation word (e.g., wow, oh, hey, alas) or an interjection.</p>
    <p>The sentence structure follows the regular pattern of subject + verb + object, but it is intensified by the strong emotion conveyed.</p>
    <p>Exclamatory sentences end with an exclamation mark (!).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wow, this coffee is amazing!</li>
            <li>Oh no, I forgot my keys!</li>
            <li>What a beautiful day it is!</li>
            <li>How incredible that performance was!</li>
            <li>What a surprise to see you here!</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exclamatory sentences always end with an exclamation mark (!).</li>
        <li>These sentences should be used sparingly, as they convey heightened emotions.</li>
        <li>They often contain interjections or descriptive adjectives to emphasize the emotional tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Sentence Transformation: Active ↔ Passive Voice & Direct ↔ Indirect Speech</h1>

    <h2>1. Active ↔ Passive Voice</h2>
    <p>Voice refers to the relationship between the subject and the verb in a sentence. Active voice means the subject performs the action, while passive voice means the subject receives the action.</p>

    <h3>Active Voice:</h3>
    <p>In active voice, the subject performs the action.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb + Object</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Active Voice: The teacher explained the lesson.</code></li>
        <li>Here, the subject ("The teacher") is performing the action of explaining the lesson.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Passive Voice:</h3>
    <p>In passive voice, the subject receives the action. The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Object + Form of "Be" + Past Participle + (by Subject)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Passive Voice: The lesson was explained by the teacher.</code></li>
        <li>Here, the object ("The lesson") becomes the subject of the sentence, and the focus shifts from the doer (the teacher) to the action (explaining).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Transforming Active to Passive:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the object in the active sentence, as it will become the subject of the passive sentence.</li>
        <li>Use the correct form of the verb "to be" according to the tense of the active sentence.</li>
        <li>Change the main verb to its past participle form.</li>
        <li>If needed, add "by" + the original subject (the agent performing the action).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Active: She writes a letter. <code>Passive: A letter is written by her.</code></li>
        <li>Active: They are building a house. <code>Passive: A house is being built by them.</code></li>
        <li>Active: He has completed the assignment. <code>Passive: The assignment has been completed by him.</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Transforming Passive to Active:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the subject of the passive sentence, as it will become the object of the active sentence.</li>
        <li>Use the correct form of the verb in its active form.</li>
        <li>Position the original subject (now the object) at the end or omit it if unnecessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Passive: The letter is written by her. <code>Active: She writes the letter.</code></li>
        <li>Passive: A house is being built by them. <code>Active: They are building a house.</code></li>
        <li>Passive: The assignment has been completed by him. <code>Active: He has completed the assignment.</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Direct ↔ Indirect Speech</h2>
    <p>Direct and indirect speech are ways of reporting what someone has said.</p>

    <h3>Direct Speech:</h3>
    <p>In direct speech, we quote the exact words spoken by a person, enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Reporting verb + "quotation marks" (Exact words spoken).</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Direct Speech: She said, "I am going to the store."</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Indirect Speech:</h3>
    <p>In indirect speech, we report what someone said without quoting their exact words. We often paraphrase the statement, making changes to pronouns, tenses, and time expressions.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Reporting verb + that + reported speech (no quotation marks).</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Indirect Speech: She said that she was going to the store.</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Transforming Direct Speech to Indirect Speech:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the quotation marks and use the reporting verb (e.g., said, told, asked).</li>
        <li>Change the pronouns to reflect the perspective of the speaker.</li>
        <li><strong>Backshift the tense:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Present simple → past simple</li>
                <li>Present continuous → past continuous</li>
                <li>Present perfect → past perfect</li>
                <li>Future simple → conditional (e.g., will → would)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Time expressions change based on the reporting time:
            <ul>
                <li>"now" → "then"</li>
                <li>"today" → "that day"</li>
                <li>"tomorrow" → "the next day"</li>
                <li>"yesterday" → "the previous day"</li>
                <li>"here" → "there"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the statement is a question:
            <ul>
                <li>Yes/no questions require "if" or "whether" (e.g., She asked if I was coming).</li>
                <li>Wh-questions retain their structure (e.g., He asked where I was going).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Direct Speech: He said, "I am learning Spanish." Indirect Speech: He said that he was learning Spanish.</code></li>
        <li><code>Direct Speech: "Where are you going?" she asked. Indirect Speech: She asked where I was going.</code></li>
        <li><code>Direct Speech: "I will help you with your homework," he said. Indirect Speech: He said that he would help me with my homework.</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rules for Transforming Indirect Speech to Direct Speech:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Revert to the original words and insert quotation marks around the reported speech.</li>
        <li>Pronouns: Return them to their original form, depending on the person being quoted.</li>
        <li>Tense: Change the verb tense to match the original quote.</li>
        <li>Time expressions: Change them back to match the time referenced in the direct speech.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
